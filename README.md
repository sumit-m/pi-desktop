# PI Desktop

A desktop GUI for the [PI coding agent](https://pi.dev). Chat, manage projects, browse files, run commands, install packages — all in one window.

Still in alpha — expect rough edges.

## What it does

- Streaming chat with thinking blocks and tool use
- Multiple workspaces, each with its own PI process and sessions
- Review rail with permissions, approvals, changed files, and session status
- File tree, code editor (CodeMirror 6 with syntax highlighting), diff viewer, file search
- Terminal with ANSI colors
- Package browser connected to pi.dev/packages
- Session tags, model switching, themes (Dark, Light, Nord, Gruvbox)

## Review rail

The right-side Review rail keeps safety and working-tree state visible while you chat with PI.

Changed files use readable status badges:

| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `NEW` | Untracked new file |
| `MOD` | Existing tracked file was modified |
| `DEL` | Tracked file was deleted |
| `ADD` | New file staged in git |
| `STG` | Modified file staged in git |
| `REN` | File was renamed |

## Getting started

You need PI installed first:

```bash
npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent

On Linux, grab the AppImage from [Releases](https://github.com/FaqFirebase/pi-desktop/releases):

```bash
chmod +x PI-Desktop-linux-x64.AppImage
./PI-Desktop-linux-x64.AppImage
```

macOS isn't shipping yet. A Windows portable `.exe` is available in [Releases](https://github.com/FaqFirebase/pi-desktop/releases) but has not been tested — I don't have a Windows machine. If you run into issues please [open a bug report](https://github.com/FaqFirebase/pi-desktop/issues).
